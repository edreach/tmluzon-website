/**
 * This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model for an e-commerce application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model combines strict user-ownership for personal data with role-based access control (RBAC)
 * for administrative functions. Standard users have complete control over their own data (reviews, cart, orders)
 * and cannot access the data of other users. Administrative users have elevated privileges to manage global
 * data like products and application settings.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data is hierarchically organized under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based ownership is
 *   the primary mechanism for securing reviews, cart items, and orders.
 * - Global data, such as `/products`, is stored in top-level collections.
 * - Admin roles are managed in a dedicated `/roles_admin` collection. The existence of a document
 *   `/roles_admin/{userId}` grants that user administrative privileges.
 * - A specific path, `/admin/dashboard/settings/tmluzon`, is used for a single settings document,
 *   accessible only by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default, and access is explicitly granted.
 * - User Data Isolation: Users can only read and write data within their own `/users/{userId}` document tree.
 *   Listing other users' documents is strictly forbidden to prevent user enumeration.
 * - Admin Privilege Check: A fast `exists()` check against the `/roles_admin` collection is used to determine
 *   if a user is an admin, granting them access to manage products and settings.
 * - Public Read, Admin Write: The `/products` collection is publicly readable by anyone (including anonymous users)
 *   to allow browsing, but all write operations are restricted to administrators.
 * - Locked Collections: The `/orders_items` collection is currently locked down (`allow read, write: if false;`)
 *   because its top-level structure prevents securely associating an order item with its owner without performing
 *   a costly and discouraged `get()` call in the rules. It should be nested under orders for secure access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Admin roles are denormalized into the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection. This allows for a simple and
 *   performant `exists()` check to verify admin status without needing to read a user's profile document.
 * - For user-owned subcollections (e.g., cart_items, orders), a `customerId` field is required on each document.
 *   Rules enforce that this field matches the `{userId}` from the path on creation and is immutable on update,
 *   ensuring relational integrity between the document's data and its path-based ownership.
